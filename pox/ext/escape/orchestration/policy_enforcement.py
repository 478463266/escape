    Meta class for handling policy enforcement in the context of classes inhereted from AbstractVirtualizer

    Therefore the function names must be identical!
    If the policy checking function retuns with True value, the original function will be called next
    If policy checking fails a PolicyEnforcementError should be raised and handled in a higher layer
    or/and at least return with False value
    To use policy checking set the following class attribute: __metaclass__ = PolicyEnforcementMetaClass
