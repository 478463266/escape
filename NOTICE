The ESCAPE uses several open source frameworks, libraries and tools which have
under different license. These dependencies are the follows:

* OpenYuma              BSD license
* NFFG                  Apache 2.0 license
* Embedding algorithm   Apache 2.0 license
* Mininet               Mininet 2.1.0+ License
* POX                   Apache 2.0 license
* Virtualzier           Apache 2.0 License

The codes are used without modification except the Mininet and POX tool:

ESCAPE use the Mininet framework to emulate an SDN-based domain for its
Infrastructure layer. The code contains additions and extensions for the most
part: the Execution Environment node and the VNF Catalogue. These additions
enable ESCAPE to emulate a topology on a single laptop and run Click-based
VNFs on these EE nodes.

ESCAPE sit on top of POX as its layers are defined as POX modules.
ESCAPE exploits POX's cooperative task environment to leverage serialized,
lock-free task execution. Also with cooperation of Mininet-based Infrastructure
ESCAPE play the role of the SDN (OpenFlow) controller and manages the flowrules
internally to steer Network Function Chains.
Due to the module-based implementation ESCAPE's source code is well separated
from POX.
However, there are some minimal refinement in POX, mostly commenting print and
logs, to avoid ambiguity on the console.
Followed the Apache license restrictions, every change is marked in place.


Many thanks to the developer of these projects and last but not least to everyone
who supported us and helped moving the ESCAPE project forward!
